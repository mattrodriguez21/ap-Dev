This drama was based on a novel by Shi Ding Rou. “The Love You Give Me” is a 2023 Chinese drama series that was directed by Ding Ying Zhou. 
Five years ago, a young woman named Min Hui accidentally fell for a young man named Xin Qi. But things between them were complicated because Min Hui was pretending to be Xin Qi's long lost childhood friend in a misguided way to help the friend who had died suddenly.
